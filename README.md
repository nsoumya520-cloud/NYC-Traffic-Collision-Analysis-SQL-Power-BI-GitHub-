1) Project Title / Headline:
🚗 NYC Traffic Collision Analysis: Power BI & SQL Dashboard
An interactive data visualization tool built to explore motor vehicle collision data across New York City—focusing on accident hotspots, trends, and risk factors related to time, location, and vehicle types.

2) Short Description / Purpose:
The NYC Traffic Collision Analysis dashboard leverages Power BI and SQL to provide an in-depth analysis of motor vehicle collision data across New York City. It helps city planners, safety analysts, and urban policy makers understand accident trends, identify high-risk areas, and inform traffic safety initiatives.

3) Tech Stack:
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
📊 PowerBI Desktop – Main platform for building dynamic, interactive visualizations.
📂 SQL – Used for extracting, cleaning, and transforming collision data from NYC Open Data.
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Applied for calculated measures and dynamic visual elements.
📁 File Format – .pbix for Power BI files, .sql for SQL queries.

4) Data Source:
Source: NYC Open Data – The dataset contains detailed records of motor vehicle collisions across New York City, with information on accident location, severity, contributing factors, vehicle types, and time of day.

5) Features / Highlights
Business Problem:
Traffic collisions in New York City are a significant public safety issue. With over a million accidents reported, it's difficult for policymakers and analysts to quickly assess the key risk areas and factors contributing to these incidents. Access to timely, actionable insights is crucial for reducing accidents and saving lives.

Goal of the Dashboard:
1)To provide an interactive Power BI tool that:
2)Enables users to explore trends in traffic collisions across NYC.
3)Helps identify high-risk locations, times, and contributing factors.
4)Assists policymakers, urban planners, and safety analysts in making informed decisions about traffic safety measures.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals:
1) Crash Overview & Hotspot Analysis (First Image)

----Total Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities:
KPIs at the top show the total crashes (1M), total injuries (390K), and total fatalities (1906). It gives a quick snapshot of the overall accident data, highlighting the scale of traffic incidents in NYC.




Fatalities per 1,000 Crashes: Shows the fatality rate in relation to the total number of crashes. The 0.18 fatalities per 1,000 crashes suggest that fatalities are a small portion of the overall crashes.

Crashes by Year (Line Graph):

A line graph showing the number of crashes per year from 2012 to 2025. This helps identify trends over time, such as a possible decline in crashes post-2021.

Injuries by Year (Bar Chart):

A bar chart showing total injuries per year. The 2018-2019 peak in injuries is clear, with a noticeable decline post-2021.

Fatality Rate (%) by Year (Line Graph):

This graph highlights the fatality rate (%) over time, with a sharp rise in 2016 followed by a steady decline from 2020 to 2025.

Fatalities as a Share of Injuries (Line Graph):

A trendline that shows fatalities as a share of injuries. It indicates how fatal accidents have fluctuated as a percentage of total injuries over the years.
